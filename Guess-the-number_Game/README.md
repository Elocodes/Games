## Guess the right number!!!

This is a game where the computer chooses a random number from 0-100 or 0-1000 (based on the choice of the player). The player is tasked to fin the number which the computer chooses. In the program, I included a logic that makes the game very tactical and requires smart reasonong from the player to guess the correct number. Each player has an allowance of 7 attempts to guess the number. 

## Further Improvements 
I hope to provide the GUI link soon, so that users interested in the code can go further to play the game for themselves
