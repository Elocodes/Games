# Guess the right number!!!

This is a game where the computer chooses a random number from 0-100 or 0-1000 (based on the choice of the player). The player is tasked to find the number which the computer chooses. In the program, I included a logic that makes the game very tactical and requires smart reasoning from the player to guess the correct number (Tip: Think Binary Search). Each player has an allowance of 7 attempts to guess the number.
