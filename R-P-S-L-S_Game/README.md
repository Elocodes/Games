## The famous game Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock

Definition: The RPSLS game can be played between 2 to 5 persons where participants choose either rock, paper, scissors, lizard or spock, and are eliminated based on the superiority of their choices; 

Here is a link to read further about the game: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors#:~:text=One%20popular%20five%2Dweapon%20expansion,sock%2Dpuppet%2Dlike%20mouth. 

In my code, I recreated a computer version of the RPSLS game. The player makes a choice and based on the random choice of the computer, either emerges a winner or looser, or it results in a tie if both made the same choice.

## Further improvements
Beyond reading the codes, I hope to provide the GUI link for playing the game in the nearest future.
