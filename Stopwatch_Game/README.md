# Stopwatch - The game

Everyone knows a stopwatch, but did you know you can get more fun out of it? Have you tried to stop it at specific timessay exactly 01:00, 02.0 etc to test your speed? 

In this code, I created a stopwatch and added functionalities that give points to players when they stop the watch at clean intervals (1:00, 2:00) etc. It is a tough game to play given the speed of stopwatch, but it is equally interesting and lets players know how fast their fingers can move and how sharp their focus can be.
