## The famous Pong game

This is a game that involves two players, their paddles, a table, and a tennis ball. Each player strives to catch and hit the ball with their paddle back to the opponent. Any miss results in points being added to your opponent. This was a tough project that required I create both static and mobile objects, and infuse velocity into the ball. In the project, Ialso made some keyboard keys functional for controlling the upward and downward movement of the paddles. The up and downarrows control the right paddle, while the "w" and "s" keys control the up and down of the left paddle respectively.

Many lines of codes brought this project to life, it is a very interesting game to play.
